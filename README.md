# Manuscript Links Service (mslink)
## Linking online data for medieval manuscripts

This resource allows you to search for a manuscript, using a canonical identifer (i.e. a reference to an authoritative catalogue), and to find links to online resources for that manuscript.

The service is currently accessible at this address:
http://www.mira.ie/mslink

Manuscript projects currently linked are:

- Earlier Latin Manuscripts | https://elmss.nuigalway.ie/
- Foundations of Irish Culture | https://www.foundationsirishculture.ie/
- Manuscripts with Irish Associations | http://www.mira.ie

Links are based on identifiers (references) in the following manuscript catalogues:

- E. A. Lowe, _Codices Latini Antiquiores_, 12 vols, (Oxford, 1934–1971)
- B. Bischoff, _Katalog der festländischen Handschriften des neunten Jahrhunderts_, 3 vols (Wiesbaden, 1998–2014)

You may freely copy the files to any other online location.

Developed by Pádraic Moran (http://www.pmoran.ie), University of Galway. 

To add links to your manuscript project, contact padraic.moran@universityofgalway.ie. Data can be supplied in a simple CSV file, with columns for catalogue code (currently "cla" or "bkat"), manuscript identifier and associated project URL.
